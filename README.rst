A few things are contained in here:

* `runalyzer` and `runalyzer-gather`, two programs to analyze many
  time series logs generated by `pytools.log.LogManager`.
* A job queuing system based on CouchDB, which can globally
  distributed compute jobs and then spew the results into a
  single SQLite file.
* `logtool`, an older (and deprecated) program to analyze a single time series
  log generated by `pytools.log.LogManager`.
