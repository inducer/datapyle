Datapyle
--------

A few things are contained in here:

* ``runalyzer`` and ``runalyzer-gather``, two programs to analyze many
  time series logs generated by ``pytools.log.LogManager``.
* A job queuing system based on CouchDB, which can run globally
  distributed compute jobs and then spew the results into a
  single SQLite file.
