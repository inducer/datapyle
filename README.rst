Datapyle
--------

A few things are contained in here:

* A job queuing system based on CouchDB, which can run globally
  distributed compute jobs and then spew the results into a
  single SQLite file.
* Analysis tools for ``pytools.log`` used to be part of this
  package, but are now being maintained in 
  `logpyle <https://github.com/illinois-ceesd/logpyle>`__.
